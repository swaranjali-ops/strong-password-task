| abc123               | 32%       | Weak      | Instant                  | Too short, uses only lowercase and digits. |
| Abc@1234             | 41%       | Good      | 3 minutes                | Added capital & symbol, still short.       |

##  Observations

- **Short passwords** are easily guessed even if they have numbers or symbols.
- Passwords that combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters** are significantly stronger.
- Adding **length** increases security exponentially.
- Personalized but unique passwords like `Sw@r@nj@l!2025*` are harder to guess but still memorable.
- **Random complex passwords** are safest, but harder to remember without a password manager.

##  What Makes a Password Strong?

- At least **12 characters long**
- Includes:
  - Uppercase letters (`A-Z`)
  - Lowercase letters (`a-z`)
  - Numbers (`0-9`)
  - Special characters (`@, #, $, !, *`)
- Avoids:
  - Dictionary words
  - Common patterns (`123`, `abc`, `password`)
  - Personal info like name, birth year

##  Password Attack Types

| Attack Type          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**      | Tries all possible combinations. Very effective on short/weak passwords.    |
| **Dictionary Attack**| Uses a list of common words or passwords to guess.                          |
| **Phishing**         | Tricks users into giving their password voluntarily.                        |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Tries previously leaked passwords on other accounts.                     |

##  Final Recommendations

- Use **password managers** to generate and store strong passwords.
- Never reuse the same password across sites.
- Change passwords regularly, especially after data breaches.
- Always enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** where available.
