## 📚 Key Learnings

- Length, complexity, and unpredictability make a password stronger.
- Passwords with dictionary words or patterns are very easy to break.
- Tools like password meters help in evaluating password safety.
- Avoid using personal info (names, birthdates) directly.

## 🛡️ Common Attacks

- **Brute Force:** Tries every possible combination.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses common passwords or words.
- **Phishing:** Tricking users into revealing their password.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Using leaked passwords from other sites.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use a mix of UPPER/lower case, numbers, symbols.
- Make it long (12+ characters).
- Don’t reuse the same password.
- Use a password manager to remember complex ones.
